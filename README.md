This repository contains my solutions to the problems from **A2OJ Ladder 15**, starting at difficulty level 4. These problems are part of a curated set designed to systematically improve competitive programming skills, covering various algorithms and data structures.

## What are A2OJ Ladders?

**A2OJ Ladders** are a series of progressive problem tracks created by **Ahmed Aly**, designed to help competitive programmers improve their problem-solving abilities. Each ladder consists of a list of problems ordered by difficulty, offering a structured approach to tackling challenges from platforms like **Codeforces**. The goal is to provide a step-by-step path, starting from easier problems and moving towards more complex ones, ensuring steady growth in solving advanced algorithmic questions.

### Benefits of A2OJ Ladders:
- **Structured Progression**: Problems are ranked by difficulty, helping participants gradually build their skills.
- **Focus on Key Algorithms**: Topics like dynamic programming, graphs, sorting, and greedy algorithms are emphasized to build a solid foundation.
- **Ideal for Contest Preparation**: These ladders are excellent for preparing for contests on platforms like Codeforces, CodeChef, and more.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains my solutions for all problems in **A2OJ Ladder 15**, starting from difficulty level 4. The solutions cover a wide range of algorithmic techniques and are implemented in **C++**.

### Structure:
- Each solution file is named after the corresponding problem's code (e.g., `231A.cpp` for the problem "Team").
- The solutions are optimized for performance and clarity, with a focus on efficient algorithms.

## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/a2oj-ladder15-solutions.git
   ```
2. Browse the problem-specific directories and access the `.cpp` files for each solution.
3. Compile and run the solutions using:
   ```bash
   g++ -o solution problem_name.cpp
   ./solution
   ```

## Acknowledgments
These problems are sourced from the **A2OJ Ladders**, and the solutions are part of my practice in competitive programming.
